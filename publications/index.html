Our results reveal that ADR centres in districts with early treatment experience an average increase of approximately 50 cases compared to those in districts with late treatment. By utilizing generalized multi-level mixed effect and two-stage least square models, we find that early implementation of PLRMIS significantly increases successful mediation outcomes by 126 cases in the treatment region with no effect on mediation failure cases.

We also additionally take care of the time trend by applying an annual fixed effect into our model. The study finds that urbanization, economic growth and trade openness significantly determine CO2 emission in the selected countries. Thus, the main policy suggestions are (a) to encourage green and sustainable urbanization, as it helps in economic progress but not at the expense of environmental deterioration; (b) to strategically regulate and improve industrial structure; and (c) enhance sharing of renewable energy in total energy consumption.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ENV</abbr> </div> <div id="ullah2020poaching" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Poaching of Asiatic Black Bear: Evidence from Siran and Kaghan Valleys, Pakistan</div> <div class="author"> Zaib Ullah, Inayat Ullah, Ikram Ullah, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

Evidence about black bear hunting and cubs poaching were collected from Siran and Kaghan valleys of district Mansehra, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province through three different methods including participants’ observations, interviews from key informants and structured questionnaire. We find local community members of both valleys to be active observers of hunting and poaching in the study area. The structured interviews with locals of the study area revealed striking facts about ongoing trafficking by hunters and traders of the neighboring districts (i.e. Kohistan and Battagram). The study identifies a tribe known as Maddi Khel in the neighboring district Battagram the member of which regularly travel to the study area for hunting of black bear, pheasants, gray goral and snow leopard. According to interviews with the local people, hunters and traders in groups from 10 to 25 persons with their own poaching arrangements including guns, pistols and well-trained domesticated dogs were seen every winter. For hunters in the study area, the main target was the killing of female black bear because killing of mothers allows them to poach their cubs. We also identify the routes i.e. Raam Gali, Door Gali, and Kunda Gali through which hunters enter from the neighboring districts Kohistan and Battagram for the purpose of poaching. During each four months season (December to March), on average, approximately 2–5 mothers are killed that carry 12 to 20 cubs. The small cubs have higher black-market demand in different cities in Pakistan that motivates hunters to continue poaching in the study area. Despite the conservation claims by the government department in the province, the ground survey reveals severe risk to the population of black bear from hunting and illegal trafficking. The government’s wildlife department staff is less equipped to tackle with hunters in winter due to the extreme weather conditions in the area and their inability to stay for longer time. </p> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper assesses the vulnerability of Asiatic black bear to poaching in a key ecological zone in Northern Pakistan.

In Pakistan, except for the province of Punjab where land-record has been computerized in 2017, the land record is largely administered through traditional land registers and cadastral maps in paper formats requiring a laborious work of administrators called “Patwaris” at the grass-root level. As an important step towards e- governance, the Punjab provincial government established a Land Record Management Information System (PLRMIS) in 2013 that simplified the procedure of land registration and transfer through digitization of land records. We evaluated the impact of the PLRMIS on dispute resolution efforts in the Punjab province through the Joint Research Project of the KDI School of Public Policy, South Korea in collaboration with the Department of Management Sciences, COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI), Attock Campus, Pakistan. We adopted a quasi-experimental approach to scientifically examine the impact of PLRMIS on land-related dispute resolution and identify key issues associated with governance of this large-scale program through a field survey. Our empirical findings provide suggestive evidence of the direct effects of the program on the number of disputes registered in Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) centres across Punjab. Our results show that on average, an ADR Centre located in the early treated district is likely to receive 40 cases more than ADR centres located in early controlled districts. We also adopt a two-stage least square approach where the program effect is instrumented to estimate effect on the number of successfully resolved disputes. Our results are robust despite controlling for covariates and entity-specific variation as well as time-trend. Our primary data collected through field surveys from four major stakeholders support the idea of increasing access to land records and related information through PLRMIS despite challenges in the implementation and operations of the program. We find significant variation in the level of use, understanding of citizens regarding access of the system and the extent to which clients are served with the PLRMIS. Very importantly, we observe that majority of those people who have conducted a land related transactions and having conflicts in those transactions, resort to the PLRMIS online facilities located in each tehsil of the districts. Our field surveys also identified key areas of the PLRMIS that need attention of government officials in order to sustainably continue this flagship program already in place across Punjab.</p> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Complexity in administration and limited accessibility to land records have been long- standing issues in developing countries.

Our identification is based on a large-scale monitoring program implemented in over 28,000 primary and secondary public schools in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, Pakistan. We find ideal conditions for a natural experiment and apply difference-in-difference, event study and instrumental variable approaches to causally attribute changes in the learning outcomes of enrolled children to the monitoring program. We utilize seven rounds of a nationally representative annually conducted independent and systematically random survey called ASER-Pakistan. Our findings suggest that technology-based monitoring has increased teachers’ attendance by nearly 8 percentage points in the first year after the program. Despite a slight decrease in the second year after the intervention, the long-run effect of the program strongly persists with significant impact on learning outcomes of enrolled children. We find that enrolled children’s standardized Reading, Math and English test score in the monitored schools has improved significantly by 0.08, 0.09 and 0.10 standard deviations points respectively at the lower (0 5) grades. Using exogenous program effect (obtained through diff-in-diff) as an instrument, we use observed variation in teachers’ attendance to predict changes in the standardized test score of children. The 2SLS results are strikingly (nearly two-times) larger than fixed-effect OLS estimates. More specifically, on average, standardized Reading, Math and English test score in the monitored region has improved significantly by .33, .22 and .62 SD points respectively at the lower (0 5) grades. We also utilize the post-merger (of two regions) data to test the difference in observed outcomes when the monitoring program was extended to the comparison region.
