Welcome to my personal website!
I currently serve as Chief of Research at <a href="https://pide.org.pk/"> Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) </a>), Islamabad. Earlier, I worked as Head of the Research Department at the <a href="https://jsppl.nust.edu.pk/">Jinnah School of Public Policy and Leadership (JSPPL)</a>, <a href="https://jsppl.nust.edu.pk/"> National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST)</a>. From 2022 to 2023, I served as Impact Evaluation Researcher under the one-year ISEF Program at the <a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html"> Seoul National University (SNU) </a>) where I worked on several impact evaluation projects. One notable project involved impact evaluation of an innovative technology-based monitoring program on learning outcomes, in which we applied Difference-in-Differences and Event Study techniques to evaluate the effect of a large-scale program in Pakistan. Our paper received the Innovative Policy Research Award for the year 2023 from the Asian Development Bank and the International Economic Association. This prestigious award, with a prize of $7,000, was formally presented during the ADB-IEA award session at the 2023 ADB Annual Meeting on May 5th, 2023 (the announcement is available at <a href="https://events.development.asia/learning-events/winners-2023-adb-iea-innovative-policy-research-award"> Winners of the 2023 ADB–IEA Innovative Policy Research Award</a>). I hold Ph.D in Public Policy from the <a href="https://www.kdischool.ac.kr/"> Korea Development Institute (KDI), School of Public Policy and Management </a>) specializing in impact evaluation of interventions for sustainable development outcomes in developing countries.
I primarily work with impact evaluation methods in experimental and quasi-experimental settings that help policy analysts assess the effectiveness of government policies in an unbiased way.
