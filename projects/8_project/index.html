Researchers based in <strong>low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)</strong> are particularly disadvantaged, facing barriers to subscriptions, licenses, and computational resources, which may limit their ability to contribute equitably to global scientific production.</p> <hr> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/p81-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/p81-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/p81-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/p81.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Global inequalities in access to AI-enabled research tools" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> AI access disparities and global knowledge production </div> <hr> <p>This project will generate <strong>systematic evidence</strong> on inequalities in access to AI technologies, assess their impacts on <strong>research productivity, collaboration, and knowledge creation</strong>, and identify policy-relevant pathways for addressing these challenges.
