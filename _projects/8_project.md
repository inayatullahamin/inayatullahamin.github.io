**The Assignment**

The project **“AI as a Global Public Good: Tackling Inequalities in Academic and Scientific Progress”** seeks to address the growing disparities in access to advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools that are rapidly transforming how research is conducted, disseminated, and utilized worldwide.

While AI-driven tools promise major gains in research efficiency, collaboration, and innovation, **unequal access**—driven by licensing restrictions, infrastructure gaps, affordability constraints, and institutional capacity—risks **widening the global knowledge divide**. Researchers based in **low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)** are particularly disadvantaged, facing barriers to subscriptions, licenses, and computational resources, which may limit their ability to contribute equitably to global scientific production.

This project will generate **systematic evidence** on inequalities in access to AI technologies, assess their impacts on **research productivity, collaboration, and knowledge creation**, and identify policy-relevant pathways for addressing these challenges. By combining **policy analysis**, **capacity-building initiatives**, and **global dialogue among researchers and institutions**, the project aims to advance the idea of **AI as a global public good**.
