**Funded by [UNICEF Pakistan](https://www.unicef.org/pakistan/)**  
**Implemented by [Oxford Policy Management (OPM)](https://www.opml.co.uk/our-locations/pakistan)**  
**Duration:** November 2023 â€“ December 2024

As a**Team Lead** at Oxford Policy Management, Islamabad office, I led a UNICEF-funded research project to assess the post-flood situation of children with disabilities in Pakistan. The study aimed to evaluate the impact of the 2022 floods on children with disabilities, focusing on access to essential services, social inclusion, and vulnerabilities in disaster-affected districts.

This post-flood assessment reveals critical gaps in meeting both basic and specialized needs of this vulnerable group, particularly in times of disaster. The findings highlight the compounded challenges faced by children with disabilities and their caregivers during the 2022 floods.

The study, conducted in **31 flood-affected districts** across Pakistan, aimed to:

- Assess the conditions and vulnerabilities of children with disabilities in the post-flood context.
- Understand the impact of the floods on their well-being.
- Identify key areas for intervention.
- Provide **evidence-based recommendations** to improve resilience and inclusion.
